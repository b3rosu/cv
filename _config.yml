          I started to rent my first droplet about a year ago for a <mark>Server administration class</mark> and after that I know that I like servers. |
        The things I got are: 
          - Email whit exim & dovecot
          - Web page with nginx (before was apache)
          - A PBX with asterisk, I have to say that it's not very useful
          - Minecraft bedrock server
          - Matrix, like a self hosted discord (is down rn)
          - FTP

          While I study I'm in CUCEI and then I leave, It's fun most of the time.

          I spent a lot of my free time in the library doing HW but not this one, this one is made at home.
